# A mode for testing your knowledge. 
# Users should first select the number of questions for the test which is not larger than the total number of questions added.
# The questions get chosen fully randomly and each question can only appear once at most in the test. 
# At the end of the questions, the user is shown the score.
# The list of scores should be saved in a separate results.txt 
# The date and time should be added next to the score as well.
